# sequencer-1
An eight step sequencer

## Overview
Inspired by the [Korg SQ-1](https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/sq_1/), the 
guiding ideas are
* tactile inputs for each of the eight steps, minimize menu/config
* build it with hobby parts (breadboard compatible), stick to the SAMD21

## Parts List
